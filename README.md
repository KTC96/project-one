### Typrography

I used [Fontjoy](https://fontjoy.com/) to experiment with font parings. I decided on  DM Mono for headings and DM sans for paragraph elements. I utilized Google fonts to use them in my project.

## Features

* Navigation Bar 
   * Featured on all five pages, the fully responsive navigation bar includes links to the Home page, content pages and quiz page. It is identical across all pages to allow for standardized style and easy navigation.
   * This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.
   * At smaller screen sizes the navigation bar transforms into a JavaScript hamburger menu, allowing the site to be visually pleasing at these sizes.

### Future Implementations

   * For future applications of the website I would like to include links to scientific papers so that the user can learn more in depth knowledge about the subject matter.
   * Add a feedback feature after completing the quiz so users can check their answers.
   * Make quiz questions randomly generate from a pool, so a wider range of knoweldge can be tested.
   * Increase the range of material covered in the site.
   * Link the quiz to a database to capture and store user data.

## Testing


## Deployment

* I deployed the site to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy the site are as follows:
   * In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
   * From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
   * Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Credits

### Code
* My coursemate Mia Rasmussen showed me how to create a JavaScript hamburger style navigation menu so my site would be responsive at smaller screen sizes.
* Creation of my nav bar as well as the general structure of the website was taken from the Love Running walkthrough tutorial.
* I watched many tutorials on flexbox to help me make my website responsive and better position elements on my site.


### Content

* The text information for each pathogen page was taken from their respective Wikipedia pages. I edited and simplified the text to make it more clear and allow it to be displayed correctly on the site. 
* The terms and conditions of the quiz page were taken from the Love Running project and adapted for my own use. 

### Media

* The images on the home page were taken from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/).
* The images on content page were taken from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/). 
* Through Pexels I also found more suitable images using [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/)
* The image of T.Brucei on the parasites page was taken by myself during unviversity study.


### Acknowldegements 

I would like to thank two of my course collegues Mia Rasmussen and Hope Tracy for their help in understanding coding concepts. I would also like to thank my mentor Jack for checking my code and supporting me through this project.
