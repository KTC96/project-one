            <img class="bacteria" src="./assets/images/TB.jpg" alt="Microscopy image of Tuberculosis">
            <p> Tuberculosis or TB is caused by the Mycobacterium Tuberculosis bacterium which mostly affects the
                lungs. The disease is spread from person to person via the air.
                When invididuals cough, sneeze or spit, they release TB into the air. Someone only needs to inhale a
                few of these particles to become sick.
                Once the bacteria is introduced into the body, an infected individual may start to develop lesions
                in the lungs or other affected organs before symptoms appear.
                When symptoms do appear, theyre usually characterized by cough, low-grade fever in the late
                afternoon, loss of appetite, weight loss, extreme tiredness, bloody sputum and night sweats.
                lesions caused by TB in the lungs lead to fluid or air leaking into the space within their lining.
                This makes it difficult for the infected individual to breathe. It can even lead to an
                eventual collapse of the affected lung due to the pressure from air or fluid. As breathing becomes
                more and more difficult, the infected individual may need help from an assistive breathing device.
                These devices may prolong the life of an individual for a time, but eventually the person will die
                as the disease spreads.

                More than 30 million people have died from TB since the World Health Organization labeled it a
                global emergency in 1993. Luckily the disease is preventable and cureable, with vaccinations and
                antibiotics avaliable.

            <p> Streptococcus bacteria can be dividied up into many subclasses. However one of the most prominant is
                Strep A. This group of Strep often causes infections in the throat and on the skin. These infections are often mild.
                However if the bacteria manage to enter the blood stream the infection can become severe and life
                threatening. These infections cause up to 500,000 deaths per year </p>
