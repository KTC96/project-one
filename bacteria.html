                <p> Tuberculosis or TB is caused  by the Mycobacterium Tuberculosis bacterium which mostly affects the lungs. The disease is spread from person to person via the air.
                    When invididuals cough, sneeze or spit, they release TB into the air. Someone only needs to inhale a few of these particles to become sick. 
                    Once the bacteria is introduced into the body, an infected individual may start to develop lesions in the lungs or other affected organs before symptoms appear. 
                    When symptoms do appear, theyre usually characterized by cough, low-grade fever in the late afternoon, loss of appetite, weight loss, extreme tiredness, bloody sputum and night sweats. 
                    lesions caused by TB in the lungs lead to fluid or air leaking into the space within their lining. This makes it difficult for the infected individual to breathe. It can even lead to an
                    eventual collapse of the affected lung due to the pressure from air or fluid. As breathing becomes more and more difficult, the infected individual may need help from an assistive breathing device. 
                    These devices may prolong the life of an individual for a time, but eventually the person will die as the disease spreads.

                    More than 30 million people have died from TB since the World Health Organization labeled it a global emergency in 1993. Luckily the disease is preventable and cureable, with vaccinations and
                    antibiotics avaliable.
