            <p>Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease. Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever,
                tiredness, vomiting, and headaches.In severe cases,it can cause jaundice, seizures, coma, or death.
                Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten by an infected mosquito.
                If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later.
                In those who have recently survived an infection, reinfection usually causes
                milder symptoms.This partial resistance disappears over months to years if the person has no
                continuing exposure to malaria.

            </p>

            <p> Malaria is caused by single-celled microorganisms of the Plasmodium group. It is spread exclusively
                through bites of infected Anopheles mosquitoes. Five species of Plasmodium can infect and be spread by
                humans. Most deaths are caused
                by P. falciparum.The mosquito bite introduces the parasites in the sporozoite form, from the mosquito's
                saliva into a person's blood.

                Sporozoites follow the bloodstream to the liver where they invade hepatocytes (liver cells) where they
                grow and divide.
                The infected hepatocytes break down and release invasive merozoites into the bloodstream.
                Here they invade red blood and replicate, causing lysis of the red blood cells and release of more
                merozoites.
                This results in a exponential cycle that amplifies the number of parasites in the patients bloodstream.
            </p>
            <p>
                Malaria is diagnosed by the microscopic examination of blood, or with antigen-based rapid
                diagnostic tests.

                The risk of disease can be reduced by preventing mosquito bites through the use of mosquito nets and
                insect repellents or with mosquito-control measures such as spraying insecticides and draining standing
                water. Several medications are available to prevent malaria for travellers in areas where the disease
                is common.

                The recommended treatment for malaria is a combination of antimalarial medications that includes
                artemisinin.
                Resistance among the parasites has developed to several antimalarial medications.

                The disease is widespread in a broad band around the equator. In 2020 there were 241 million cases of
                malaria worldwide resulting in an estimated 627,000 deaths.

                <p> Schistosomiasis, also known as snail fever, bilharzia, and Katayama fever, is a disease caused
                    by parasitic flatworms called schistosomes.The urinary tract or the intestines may be infected.
                    Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stool, or blood in the urine. Those who have been
                    infected for a long time may experience liver damage, kidney failure, infertility, or bladder
                    cancer.
                    In children, it may cause poor growth and learning difficulty.




                </p>
                <p>The disease is spread by contact with fresh water contaminated with the parasites. These parasites
                    are released from infected freshwater snails. The disease is especially common among children in
                    developing countries, as they are more likely to play in contaminated water. Other high-risk groups
                    include farmers, fishermen, and people using unclean water during daily living.

                    Infected Schistosoma individuals release eggs into water via their fecal material or urine. After
                    larvae hatch from these eggs, the larvae infect specific types of freshwater snails. The schistosome
                    larvae
                    undergo the next phaseof their lifecycles in these snails, spending their time reproducing and
                    developing.
                    Once this step hasbeen completed, the parasite leaves the snail and enters the water column. The
                    parasite can
                    live in thewater for only 48 hours without a mammalian host. Once a host has been found, the worm
                    enters
                    its blood
                    vessels. For several weeks, the worm remains in the vessels, continuing its development into its
                    adult
                    phase. When maturity is reached, mating occurs and eggs are produced. Eggs enter the
                    bladder/intestine
                    and are excreted through urine and feces and the process repeats. If the eggs do not get excreted,
                    they
                    can become engrained in the body tissues and cause a variety of problems such as immune reactions
                    and
                    organ damage.
                </p>



                <p>

                    Diagnosis is by finding eggs of the parasite in a person's urine or
                    stool.It can also be confirmed by finding antibodies against the disease in the blood.
                    Methods of preventing the disease include improving access to clean water and reducing the number of
                    snails. In areas where the disease is common, the medication praziquantel may be given once a year
                    to
                    the entire group.

                    Schistosomiasis affected about 236.6 million people worldwide in 2019. An estimated 4,400 to 200,000
                    people die from it each year.

            <p>African trypanosomiasis, also known as African sleeping sickness or simply sleeping sickness, is a
                parasitic
                infection of humans and other animals, usually transmitted by the bite of an infected tsetse fly. It is
                caused by the species Trypanosoma
                brucei.

                Weeks to months later, the second stage begin with confusion, poor coordination, numbness, and trouble
                sleeping.


            </p>
            <p>The tsetse fly serves as both a host and vector for the trypanosome parasites. While taking blood from a
                mammalian host,
                an infected tsetse fly injects metacyclic trypomastigotes into skin tissue. From the bite, parasites
                first enter the lymphatic system
                and then pass into the bloodstream. Inside the mammalian host, they transform into bloodstream
                trypomastigotes, and are carried to other sites throughout the body, reach other body fluids (e.g.,
                lymph, spinal fluid), and continue to replicate. </p>

            <p>Diagnosis is by finding the parasite in a blood smear or in the fluid of a lymph node. A lumbar puncture
                is often needed to tell
                the difference between first- and second-stage disease.If the disease is not treated quickly it can
                lead to death.


                Prevention of severe disease involves screening the at-risk population.
                Treatment is easier when the disease is detected early and before neurological symptoms occur. Treatment
                is avaliable but only usually effective for early infections and late stage medication has serious side
                effects.


                The disease occurs regularly in some regions of sub-Saharan Africa. An estimated 11,000 people were
                infected with 2,800 new
                infections in 2015. In 2015 it caused around 3,500 deaths, down from 34,000 in 1990.</p>
