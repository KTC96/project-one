            <p>

                Rabies is a viral disease that causes encephalitis (swelling of the brain) in humans and other mammals.
                Early symptoms can include fever and tingling at the site of exposure. These symptoms are followed by
                one or more of the
                following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, violent movements, uncontrolled excitement, fear of water, an
                inability to move parts of the body, confusion, and loss of consciousness. Once symptoms
                appear, the result is virtually always death, regardless of treatment. The time period between
                contracting the disease and the start of symptoms is usually one to three months but can vary from less
                than one week to more than one year. The time depends on the distance the virus must travel along
                peripheral nerves to reach the central nervous system. Rabies is caused by lyssaviruses, which are
                spread when an infected animal bites or scratches a human or
                other animals. Saliva from an infected animal can also transmit rabies if the saliva comes into contact
                with the eyes, mouth, or nose.Dogs are the most common animal involved in transmission.

            </p>
            <p>

                Animal control and vaccination programs have decreased the risk of rabies from dogs in a number of
                regions of the world. Immunizing people before they are exposed is recommended for those at high
                risk, including those who work with bats or who spend prolonged periods in areas of the world where
                rabies is common.
                In people who have been exposed to rabies, the rabies vaccine and sometimes rabies
                immunoglobulin are effective in preventing the disease if the person receives the treatment before the
                start of rabies symptoms.

            </p>
            <p>

                Washing bites and scratches for 15 minutes with soap and water,
                povidone-iodine, or detergent may reduce the number of viral particles and may be somewhat effective at
                preventing transmission. As of 2016, only fourteen people were documented to have survived a
                rabies infection after showing symptoms.

                Rabies causes about 59,000 deaths worldwide per year, with more than 95% of human deaths from rabies
                occuring in Africa and Asia.

                Rabies is present in more than 150 countries and on all continents but Antarctica.

            <p> Human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is a spectrum
                of conditions caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which is a
                retrovirus. Following initial infection an individual may not notice any symptoms, or may experience
                a brief period of flu-like illness. This is usually followed by a long incubation
                period with no symptoms. With progression of infection there is increased interference with the immune
                system,which increases the risk of developing common infections. Late stage infection symptoms are
                referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>The main transmission route for HIV is unprotected sex, contaminated hypodermic
                needles or blood transfusions, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or
                breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva, sweat and tears, do not transmit the virus. Methods
                of prevention include safe sex,
                needle exchange programs, treating those who are infected, as well as both pre- and post-exposure
                prophylaxis. Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child
                antiretroviral medication.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p> HIV made the jump from other primates to humans in west-central Africa in the early-to-mid 20th
                century. The disease is estimated to have caused at least 40 million deaths worldwide. In 2021, there
                were 650,000 deaths and about 38 million people worldwide
                living with HIV.Although there is no broadly available cure or vaccine, antiretroviral treatment can
                slow the course of the disease and may lead to a near-normal life
                expectancy.Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made. Without treatment, the
                average survival time after infection is 11 years.</p>

            <p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by a virus, the severe acute
                respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in
                December 2019.

                The symptoms of COVID‑19 are variable but usually include a fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing
                difficulties, loss of smell, and loss of taste.Symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after
                exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable
                symptoms. Most patients (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms while 14% develop severe symptoms and 5%
                develop critical symptoms. Older people are at a higher risk of developing severe
                symptoms. Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery,
                and damage to organs has been observed.


            </p>
            <br>
            <p> COVID‑19 transmits when people breathe air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles
                containing the virus. The risk of breathing these is highest when people are in close proximity, but
                they can be inhaled over longer distances, particularly indoors. Transmission can also occur if
                contaminated fluids are splashed or sprayed in the eyes, nose, or mouth, or, more rarely, via
                contaminated surfaces. People remain contagious for up to 20 days and can spread the virus even if they
                do not develop symptoms.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>

                Several COVID-19 vaccines have been approved and distributed in various countries, which have initiated
                mass vaccination campaigns. Other preventive measures include physical or social distancing,
                quarantining, ventilation of indoor spaces, use of face masks or coverings in public, covering coughs
                and sneezes, hand washing, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face. There have been 700 million confirmed Covid-19
                cases worldwide, with 7 million confirmed deaths. However through analysis excess deaths globally it is thought that there
                could be between 16- 28 million deaths.
